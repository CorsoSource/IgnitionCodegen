# This workflow packages the application and uploads the light .jar and fat .jar as release assets.
# It triggers on the creation of any tag. The release will have the same name as the tag and be marked as draft.
# The jar files must be named as follows:
#   ignition-codegen-openapi-generator-${{ github.ref_name }}.jar
#   target/ignition-codegen-openapi-generator-${{ github.ref_name }}-jar-with-dependencies.jar
# github.ref_name will be the name of the tag (e.g. 1.0.0)
